Step 2: Run the program.  `python main.py` for a CLI or `python main.py test` to evaluate a few test expressions.

Step 3: After you've evaluated some expressions, run tensorboard on the logs to visualize your tensor graph.

`tensorboard --logdir logs/`

Then go to http://localhost:6006/#graphs to view.
